        Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers
        the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It evolved
        from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory
        in artificial intelligence.

        Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods
        based on artificial neural networks. The adjective "deep" refers to
        the use of multiple layers in the network.

        Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer
        science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions
        between computers and human language.
