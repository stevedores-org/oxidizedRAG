## 🔧 Installation & Build

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Ollama installed and running (for LLM models)

### Building

```bash
# From the project root directory
cargo build --release -p graphrag-cli

# The binary will be available at:
# ./target/release/graphrag-cli
```

### Add to PATH (optional)

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release"

# Or create a symbolic link
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/target/release/graphrag-cli /usr/local/bin/graphrag-cli
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Launch the Interactive TUI

```bash
# Basic launch
./target/release/graphrag-cli

# With configuration file
./target/release/graphrag-cli --config docs-example/symposium_config.toml

# With specific workspace
./target/release/graphrag-cli --workspace my_project

# With debug logging
./target/release/graphrag-cli --debug
```

### 2. First Time Setup

1. **Start the TUI:**
   ```bash
   ./target/release/graphrag-cli
   ```

2. **Load a configuration:**
   In the TUI, press `Shift+Tab` to enter command mode, then type:
   ```
   /config docs-example/symposium_config.toml
   ```

3. **Load a document:**
   ```
   /load docs-example/platos_symposium.txt
   ```

4. **Execute queries:**
   Return to Query Mode (press `Shift+Tab`) and type:
   ```
   What does Socrates say about love?
   ```

---

## 🎯 Usage Modes

GraphRAG-CLI has **two primary modes**:

### 📝 Query Mode
- **Purpose:** Execute queries on the knowledge graph
- **How to use:** Type your question directly
- **Example:** `What are the main themes in the Symposium?`
- **Border color:** Green

### ⚙️ Command Mode
- **Purpose:** Execute system commands (slash commands)
- **How to use:** Press `Shift+Tab` to switch from Query Mode
- **Example:** `/config myfile.toml`
- **Border color:** Yellow

**Switch between modes:** `Shift+Tab`

---

## 🔀 Slash Commands

Slash commands are only available in **Command Mode**.

### `/config <file>`
Load a GraphRAG configuration file (TOML or JSON5)

```bash
# Example with TOML
/config docs-example/symposium_config.toml

# Example with absolute path
/config /home/user/graphrag-rs/my_config.toml

# Example with relative path
/config ../config/templates/academic_research.toml
```

**What it does:**
- Loads LLM configuration (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
- Configures embeddings and chunking strategy
- Initializes the knowledge graph

---

### `/load <file>`
Load and process a document into the knowledge graph

```bash
# Load a text file
/load docs-example/platos_symposium.txt

# Load a markdown file
/load ~/documents/research_paper.md

# Load multiple documents (execute multiple times)
/load document1.txt
/load document2.txt
/load document3.txt
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads the document
2. Splits into chunks (based on config)
3. Extracts entities and relationships using **REAL LLM calls** (not pattern matching!)
4. Builds the knowledge graph
5. Generates embeddings

**Processing time (with TRUE LLM gleaning extraction):**
- **Small docs** (5-10 pages): 5-15 minutes
- **Medium docs** (50-100 pages): 30-60 minutes
- **Large docs** (500-1000 pages): 2-4 hours

This is REAL semantic extraction with multi-round LLM refinement, not instant pattern matching!

---

### `/stats`
Show knowledge graph statistics

```bash
/stats
```

**Output:**
```
Knowledge Graph Statistics:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📚 Documents:      3
📄 Chunks:         127
👤 Entities:       45
🔗 Relationships:  89
📊 Graph Density:  0.087
```

---

### `/entities [filter]`
List entities in the knowledge graph with optional filter

```bash
# List all entities
/entities

# Filter by name
/entities socrates

# Filter by type
/entities PERSON

# Filter by concept
/entities love
```

**Output:**
```
Entities (filtered: "socrates"):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

👤 Socrates [PERSON]
   Mentions: 34
   Confidence: 0.95
   Description: Greek philosopher, student of Plato...

💡 Socratic Method [CONCEPT]
   Mentions: 12
   Confidence: 0.89
   Description: Method of inquiry through questioning...
```

---

### `/workspace <name>`
Switch to a different workspace

```bash
# Switch workspace
/workspace my_project

# Switch to different workspace
/workspace philosophy_research
```

**What are workspaces?**
- Separate directories for different projects
- Each workspace has its own knowledge graph
- Each workspace has its own query history
- Allows working on multiple projects simultaneously

---

### `/help`
Show list of all available commands

```bash
/help
```

---

## 🗂️ Workspace Management

Workspaces allow you to organize multiple projects separately.

### Terminal Commands

```bash
# List all workspaces
./target/release/graphrag-cli workspace list

# Create new workspace
./target/release/graphrag-cli workspace create philosophy_research

# Show workspace information
./target/release/graphrag-cli workspace info <workspace-id>

# Delete workspace
./target/release/graphrag-cli workspace delete <workspace-id>
```

### Example: Create and Use a Workspace

```bash
# 1. Create workspace
./target/release/graphrag-cli workspace create philosophy_research

# Output:
# ✅ Workspace created successfully!
#    Name: philosophy_research
#    ID:   a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
#
# Use it with: graphrag-cli tui --workspace a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890

# 2. Start TUI with the workspace
./target/release/graphrag-cli --workspace a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890

# 3. In the TUI, load configuration and documents
# (command mode)
/config docs-example/symposium_config.toml
/load docs-example/platos_symposium.txt
```

### Workspace Paths

Workspaces are saved in:
```
~/.local/share/graphrag-cli/workspaces/
└── <workspace-id>/
    ├── metadata.json          # Workspace information
    ├── query_history.json     # Query history

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Configuration not loaded"

**Symptoms:** Cannot load documents or execute queries

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Make sure to load configuration first
/config path/to/config.toml

# 2. Verify the file exists
ls -la path/to/config.toml

# 3. Check TOML syntax
cat path/to/config.toml
```

---

### Problem: "Failed to connect to Ollama"

**Symptoms:** Errors during document loading or queries

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Verify Ollama is running
ollama list

# 2. Start Ollama if necessary
ollama serve

# 3. Test connection
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# 4. Verify configured model is available
ollama list | grep qwen3
```

---

### Problem: "Document processing is slow"

**Symptoms:** Document loading takes a very long time

**NOTE:** This is **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR** with real LLM-based gleaning extraction!
- Small docs (5-10 pages): 5-15 minutes
- Medium docs (50-100 pages): 30-60 minutes
- Large docs (500-1000 pages): 2-4 hours

**This is NOT a bug** - it's genuine semantic extraction with real LLM API calls.

**If you need faster processing (lower quality):**
```toml
# Speed optimizations in config.toml

[entities]
max_gleaning_rounds = 2      # Reduce from 4 to 2
use_llm_completion_check = false  # Skip LLM completion check

[text.chunking]
chunk_size = 1000            # Larger chunks = fewer LLM calls
chunk_overlap = 50           # Reduce overlap

[ollama]
chat_model = "llama3.1:3b"   # Use smaller/faster model
```

---

### Problem: "TUI is corrupted/garbled"

**Symptoms:** Strange characters, corrupted layout

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Reset terminal
reset

# 2. Check TERM variable
echo $TERM
# Should be: xterm-256color or similar

# 3. Set if necessary
export TERM=xterm-256color

# 4. Restart TUI
./target/release/graphrag-cli
```

---

### Problem: "Workspace not found"

**Symptoms:** Error loading workspace

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. List available workspaces
./target/release/graphrag-cli workspace list

# 2. Create new workspace if necessary
./target/release/graphrag-cli workspace create my_project

# 3. Use correct ID
./target/release/graphrag-cli --workspace <correct-id>
```

---

### Problem: "Out of memory"

**Symptoms:** Crashes during large document processing

**Solution:**
```toml
# Reduce memory usage in config.toml

[text.chunking]
max_tokens = 300  # Reduce chunk size
overlap = 20      # Reduce overlap

[embeddings]
batch_size = 16   # Reduce batch for embeddings

[caching]
enabled = true    # Enable caching to save RAM
max_size_mb = 100 # Limit cache size
```

---

## 📊 Recommended Configurations

### For Small Documents (<100KB)

```toml
[text.chunking]
method = "semantic"
max_tokens = 500
overlap = 50

[entity.extraction]
use_gleaning = true
max_iterations = 3
```

### For Large Documents (>1MB)

```toml
[text.chunking]
method = "simple"
max_tokens = 300
overlap = 20

[entity.extraction]
use_gleaning = false
max_iterations = 1

[caching]
enabled = true
max_size_mb = 500
```

### For Maximum Performance

## 🚀 Tips & Tricks

### 1. Use Query History

- Press `↑` / `↓` to navigate previous queries
- Edit and re-execute queries quickly
- History is persistent per workspace

### 2. Organize by Projects

```bash
# Create workspace for each project
graphrag-cli workspace create project_A
graphrag-cli workspace create project_B
graphrag-cli workspace create project_C

# Switch quickly between projects
graphrag-cli --workspace <project_A_id>
```

### 3. Optimize Performance

```toml
# Enable all performance features
[async_processing]
enabled = true
max_concurrent_operations = 8

[caching]
enabled = true
cache_embeddings = true

[parallel]
max_workers = 4
```

### 4. Debugging

```bash
# Start with debug logging
graphrag-cli --debug

# Logs are saved in:
# Linux: ~/.local/share/graphrag-cli/logs/graphrag-cli.log
# View logs in real-time:
tail -f ~/.local/share/graphrag-cli/logs/graphrag-cli.log
```

### 5. Batch Processing

```bash
# Use script to load many documents
for file in documents/*.txt; do
  echo "/load $file"
done > commands.txt

# Then execute manually in TUI
# (or integrate with future automation)
```
